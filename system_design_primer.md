## System Design Primer

### Introduction
System design knowledge matters for two reasons. First, companies test it in interviews, especially at senior levels. Second, it seperates competent engineers from exceptional ones. Writing code is table stakes. Designing robust, scalable systems requires deeper expertise.

### What is System Design?
Google, Amazon and Netflix serve billions of users while handling terabytes of data and traffic spikes. They remain fast, reliable and secure. This requires carefeully designed systems optimized for efficiency at massive scale.<br>
System design creates the blueprint for every successful application. It combines database, APIs, caching layers, load balancers, and distributed queues into a coherent whole. These components must work together to deliver smooth user experiences.<br>
Technical decisions directly impact performance, scaling and adaptability. A system must stay fast when traffic doubles overnight. It must tolerate faults so server crashes don't affect users. It must store and retrieve data quickly while managing costs.
