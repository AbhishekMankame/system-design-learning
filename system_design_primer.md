## System Design Primer

### Introduction
System design knowledge matters for two reasons. First, companies test it in interviews, especially at senior levels. Second, it seperates competent engineers from exceptional ones. Writing code is table stakes. Designing robust, scalable systems requires deeper expertise.

### What is System Design?
Google, Amazon and Netflix serve billions of users while handling terabytes of data and traffic spikes. They remain fast, reliable and secure. This requires carefeully designed systems optimized for efficiency at massive scale.<br>
System design creates the blueprint for every successful application. It combines database, APIs, caching layers, load balancers, and distributed queues into a coherent whole. These components must work together to deliver smooth user experiences.<br>
Technical decisions directly impact performance, scaling and adaptability. A system must stay fast when traffic doubles overnight. It must tolerate faults so server crashes don't affect users. It must store and retrieve data quickly while managing costs. System design addresses these questions. <br>
At its core, system design solves problems at scale. Getting a feature working for one user is straightforward. Making it work for millions efficiently and reliably requires balancing competing priorities: speed versus cost, consistency versus availability, simplicity versus flexibility. The challenge lies in finding the right trade-offs for each specific use case.

### What are system design interviews?
Writing code becomes less central as careers progress. Companies need engineers who design systems that handle high traffic, make decisions balancing cost and performance, and lead technical discussions. System design interviews assess these capabilities.<br>
These interviews appear at mid-level and senior positions. They increasingly appear for new graduates as well. At these levels, engineers contribute to application architecture and make design choices affecting entire systems. Interviews simulate real-world scenarios involving scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.
