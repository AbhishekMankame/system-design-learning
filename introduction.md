## What is System Design?
At its core, system design is about making decisions that affect the overall structure of a system, keeping in mind how different parts of the system will interact with each other.
<br>The goal is to build a solution that meets the business requirements while being efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

### Key Concepts in System Design
1. Scalability: How well the system can handle an increasing number of users, requests, or data.
2. Reliability: How dependable the system is in terms of uptime and consistency.
3. Fault Tolerance: The system's ability to continue functioning correctly even if parts of it fail.
4. Maintainability: How easy it is to update and modify the system.
5. Latency: The time delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer.
6. Throughput: The amount of data processed by the system in a given period.
7. Load Balancing: Distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.
