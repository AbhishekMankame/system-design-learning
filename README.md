# system-design-learning
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I try to make sense of all things system design! This repo will be packed with notes, sketches, and some code snippets to help untangle the mysteries of building big, scalable and reliable systems without losing your mind.

## What's inside? (More precisely what will be inside)
- Handy notes that won't put you to sleep
- Architecture diagrams (hopefully)
- Code snippets to get your hand dirty
- Tips and tricks for making systems that don't freak out under pressure

This is a work-in-progress, so expect it to grow and evolve-kind of like a system under constant load!!!
